📝 AutoCorrect Tool

A lightweight web-based tool that used the [LanguageTool API](https://languagetool.org/http-api/) to check and suggest grammar, spelling and style corrections in English. Built with Python and Javascript.

🚀 Features

- 🌐 Simple local HTTP server using http.server
- 🧠 Real-time grammar and spelling suggestions via LanguageTool
- ✍️ Interactive interface to view and apply suggestions
- 🎨 Clean and responsive UI with HTML/CSS

📡 How it Works

- The server.py file sets up a local server.
- When you click **"Check & Correct"**, the frontend sends a POST request to /check.
- The server forwards the text to **LanguageTool’s API**.
- The API returns grammar/spelling suggestions, which are displayed interactively.
- Clicking on a suggestion applies the change to the text.


📦 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Internet connection (to reach LanguageTool's API)
